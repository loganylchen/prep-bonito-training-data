* Replace `loganylchen` and `basecalling-tuning-workflow` everywhere in the template (also under .github/workflows) with the correct `basecalling-tuning-workflow` name and owning user or organization.
* Replace `<name>` with the workflow name (can be the same as `basecalling-tuning-workflow`).
* Replace `<description>` with a description of what the workflow does.
* The workflow will occur in the snakemake-workflow-catalog once it has been made public. Then the link under "Usage" will point to the usage instructions if `loganylchen` and `basecalling-tuning-workflow` were correctly set.
